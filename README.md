# Deck Builder App

## Description

This app allows users to build cutom decks from a given set of 12 different cards. A deck can contain multiples of any card. Decks are automatically updated on the serve whenever a card is added to or removed from them. Decks can always be loaded from the load decks drop menu.

## Planning:
I started by planning out the different files I would need and how they would be organized in the project folder. When I started the project I tackled issues in the following order:

1. Basic html<br />
2. Basic css<br />
3. Authentication<br />
4. Scss and bootstrap<br />
5. Heroku publishing<br />
6. Back-end functionality<br />
7. Front-end functionality<br />
7. Clean-up<br />

## Future Improvements:
The biggest future improvement to this project, asside from improved functionality, would be visual formatting which is largely absent from this app.

## User Stories:

1. A user can register
2. A user can log in
3. A user can change password
4. A user can log out
5. A user can create a new deck
6. A user can load a deck
7. A user can add cards to a deck
8. A user can remove cards from a deck
9. A user can not remove a card another user added to a deck

## ERD

A User owns many card_links,
A card has many card_links,
A deck has many card_links
