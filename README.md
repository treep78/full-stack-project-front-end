## Planning:
I started by planning out the different files I would need and how they would be organized in the project folder. When I started the project I tackled issues in the following order
1. Basic html
2. Basic css
3. Authentication
4. Scss and bootstrap
5. Heroku publishing
6. Back-end functionality
7. Front-end functionality
7. Clean-up

## Future Improvements:
The biggest future improvement to this project, asside from improved functionality, would be visual formatting which is largely absent from this app
