## Planning:
I started by planning out the different files I would need and how they would be organized in the project folder. When I started the project I tackled issues in the following order
1. Basic html
2. Basic css
3. Authentication
4. Scss and bootstrap
5. Heroku publishing
6. Back-end functionality
7. Front-end functionality
7. Clean-up

## Future Improvements:
The biggest future improvement to this project, asside from improved functionality, would be visual formatting which is largely absent from this app

## User Stories:

1. A user can register
2. A user can log in
3. A user can change password
4. A user can log out
5. A user can create a new deck
6. A user can load a deck
7. A user can add cards to a deck
8. A user can remove cards from a deck
